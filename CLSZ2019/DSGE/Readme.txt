1. Run mainfile.m to replicate the results. Note that before running mainfile.m, you need to input information on the type of the shock by changing codes in line 5:

set token = 1 to generate Table 4, Panel A and Figure 3 in the draft (aggregate shock)
set token = 2 to generate Table 1 and Figure 1 in the appendix.      (SOE specific shock)
set token = 3 to generate Table 4, Panel B and Figure 4 in the draft (POE specific shock)

mainfile.m will run optimal_Taylor.m to calculate the optimal policy coefficients, run display_simple.m to generate tables, and run plot_irfs4.m to generate figures.

If you want to save time to skip the policy optimization setep, you could delete optimal_Taylor.m in line 8 in mainfile.m and then run it. The results generated by optimal_Taylor.m included in the codes (respolicy_Agg.mat, respolicy_AP.mat and respolicy_AS.mat).

2. Run steady_state_analysis.m to display steady state effect of RR. (related to Section 4.2 in page 20)
