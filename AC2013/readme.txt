All codes are written in Matlab. They were first developed using Matlab R2008, but should be compatible with the lastest version too.

Figure_2_3.m replicates figures 2 and 3 of the paper.

Figure_5_8.m replicates figures 5 through 8 of the paper. This file makes use of the function optimal_grouping_c.m which computes our optimal groups using the method developed by Aghevli and Mehran (1981).

Figure_9.m replicates figure 9 and generates Table 1.

table_2.m produces the table 2 in the paper in a LaTeX form. It makes us of the econometrics toolbox developed by James Lesage and available from his web page. Note that this file assumes that the function main_optigroup.m was run first. This function produces various indicators and saves them into files that that are used in the table_2.m file. Also note that these files are present in the data directory.

All needed data are in the data directory and should be readable in any text editor.
