This archive contains material to replicate the model results of the paper
"Booms and Banking Crises" by F. Boissay, F. Collard and F. Smets

All files are coded in the MATLAB programming language.

main_rbc.m 			: Solves (non-linearly) and computes the IRFs to a 1 
                      std. dev shock of a standard RBC model, which corresponds
                      to the first best allocation for our model. It is advisable
                      to run this file first as the main.m file makes use of 
                      some results generated by this version of the model.

main.m 				: the main file that solves and produces results for our
                      model. It computes, IRFs (and compares them to the RBC
                      version), simulations, the typical path and computes 
                      the statistics that are reported in the paper. This 
                      file calls functions that are contained in the gen_tools
                      and model_tools folders.

simulate_markov.m 	: Simulate markov chain
simulate_markov2.m 	: Simulate 2 Markov chains at the same time (just to 
                      speed up the computation of IRFs)

                             current version
compute_steady_state_rbc.m : Computes steady state of the RBC by iterating 
                             on decision rules (stochastic)

NOTE: If you want to compute the probability regressions of Table 5 in the 
paper, you need to have Jim Lesage's econometric toolbox installed in your 
Matlab distribution. This toolbox can be freely downloaded from
